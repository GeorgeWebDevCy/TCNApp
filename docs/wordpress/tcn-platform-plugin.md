# TCN Platform WordPress Plugin

The TCN Platform plugin bundles the network marketing (MLM) engine and the GN Password Login REST API into a single, modular WordPress package. Deploy it on WooCommerce-powered membership sites to automate tier upgrades, sponsor tracking, downline reporting, and mobile authentication flows consumed by the TCNApp client.

## üì¶ Modules

| Module | Description | Default |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| **Membership & MLM** | Seeds WooCommerce membership products, manages tier progression, commissions, genealogy, shortcodes, admin tools, and REST endpoints under `tcn-mlm/v1/*`. | Enabled (locked) |
| **Password Login API** | Exposes the `gn/v1` REST endpoints for login, registration, password resets, and token-based cross-origin authentication. Includes rate limiting, HTTPS enforcement, and optional CORS origin whitelisting. | Enabled |

Toggle modules under **TCN Platform ‚Üí Modules**. The Membership & MLM module stays active because the plugin‚Äôs core data models depend on it. The Password Login API module can be switched off if another authentication layer is already in place; the original `GN_Password_Login_API` class remains available for backwards compatibility.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- WordPress 6.0+
- WooCommerce 7.0+
- PHP 7.4+
- MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+
- HTTPS (strongly recommended; REST login endpoints reject non-SSL requests unless `Allow HTTP During Development` is enabled while `WP_DEBUG` is true)

## üöÄ Installation

1. Copy this repository into `wp-content/plugins/tcn-platform` (or clone it directly).
2. Activate **TCN Platform** from the WordPress admin.
3. Visit **TCN Platform** in the sidebar to review module toggles, configure the Password Login API (allowed origin, dev HTTPS overrides), and adjust membership defaults.
4. Flush permalinks (`Settings ‚Üí Permalinks ‚Üí Save`) so WooCommerce account endpoints take effect.

## üß© Module Configuration

### Modules Card
- **Membership & MLM** (locked): Core automation and REST APIs. Always on.
- **Password Login API**: Disable if you only need the MLM stack and have another authentication mechanism. When enabled, configure the fields below.

### Password Login API Settings
- **Allowed CORS Origin** ‚Äì Exact origin (scheme + host + optional port) allowed to call `gn/v1` endpoints cross-origin. Leave blank to restrict to same-origin requests.
- **Allow HTTP During Development** ‚Äì Permits non-HTTPS requests when `WP_DEBUG` is true. Only enable for local development environments.

These settings persist in the `gn_login_api_settings` option. A compatibility shim keeps `GN_Password_Login_API` usable for legacy code.

## üìä Activity Monitoring

- Review REST API usage and plugin events from **TCN Platform ‚Üí Activity Log**.
- The log captures calls to `gn/v1/*` and `tcn-mlm/v1/*` namespaces, redacting sensitive payload fields like passwords and tokens.
- Activation, deactivation, settings changes, and manual log clears are also recorded so administrators can audit configuration changes.

## üíº Membership & MLM Highlights

- Seeds Blue/Gold/Platinum/Black WooCommerce products on activation, maintaining pricing alignment with the mobile catalogue.
- Tracks sponsor/direct recruit relationships with automatic upgrades through Gold ‚Üí Platinum ‚Üí Black as network conditions are met.
- Schedules background syncs to keep membership product pricing, categories, and metadata aligned with configured defaults.
- Exposes shortcodes:
  - `[tcn_member_dashboard]` ‚Äì Earnings, counts, ledger history.
  - `[tcn_genealogy]` ‚Äì Interactive downline tree.
  - `[tcn_mlm_optin]` ‚Äì Simple opt-in container for custom messaging.
- Adds **MLM Dashboard** and **MLM Genealogy** entries to WooCommerce My Account navigation (`/my-account/tcn-member-dashboard/`, `/my-account/tcn-genealogy/`).
- REST endpoints under `tcn-mlm/v1/*` expose member profiles, genealogy trees, and commission summaries (`/member`, `/genealogy`, `/commissions`) that power the TCNApp dashboards.

## üì± TCNApp Mobile Alignment

TCN Platform keeps the WooCommerce catalogue aligned with the membership products consumed by the TCNApp mobile client. Default pricing now mirrors the THB membership matrix so the web checkout and in-app upsells stay consistent:

| Tier | Mobile Label | Default Price (THB) | Notes |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| Blue | Customer | ‡∏ø0 | Baseline storefront access with no commissions. |
| Gold | Affiliate | ‡∏ø500 | Earns THB125 on each direct recruit and unlocks passive rewards after two directs. |
| Platinum | Leader | ‡∏ø1,200 | Awards THB250 on new directs while maintaining THB125 passive overrides. |
| Black | Elite | ‡∏ø2,000 | Leadership renewal tier with continued THB125 passive income from downline activity. |

Sites can override these amounts from **TCN Platform ‚Üí Membership Defaults**, but the seeded WooCommerce products and mobile catalogue remain in sync by default.

## üîë Password Login API Endpoints

All endpoints live under `wp-json/gn/v1`:

| Route | Method | Description |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| `/login` | POST | Authenticate via username/email + password. Supports `mode=cookie` for same-origin flows or returns a one-time token for cross-origin login hand-offs. Includes rate limiting and token locking via filters. |
| `/register` | POST | Register a new user with validation for username, email, and password strength. Fires `gn_password_api_user_registered`. |
| `/forgot-password` | POST | Start core WordPress reset workflow without leaking user existence. |
| `/reset-password` | POST | Complete a reset using a verification code (custom or stored). |
| `/change-password` | POST | Authenticated password change with verification of the current password. |

Additional helpers:
- `GN_Password_Login_API::issue_reset_verification_code( $user_id, $ttl )` for generating short-lived verification codes.
- Cross-origin CORS headers respect the configured allowed origin.
- HTTPS enforcement can be relaxed via `gn_password_api_allow_dev_http` filter for bespoke dev setups.

The legacy class name `GN_Password_Login_API` is aliased to the new service for backwards compatibility, so older bootstrap code continues working.

## üõ† Developer Notes

- See [`docs/TCN_PLATFORM_REFERENCE.md`](docs/TCN_PLATFORM_REFERENCE.md) for a function-by-function and endpoint-by-endpoint reference covering hooks, parameters, authentication, and example payloads designed for the built-in API tester.
- The plugin keeps using the bundled [Plugin Update Checker](https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker) library to fetch releases from GitHub. Adjust `TCN_PLATFORM_UPDATE_REPOSITORY_URL` and `TCN_PLATFORM_UPDATE_REPOSITORY_BRANCH` constants or the corresponding filters to change the source.
- Services are registered through a lightweight service container (`TCN\Platform\Plugin`). Modules hook into this container to decide which services boot.
- Activation seeds module options, membership defaults, WooCommerce endpoints, and products. Deactivation clears scheduled events and flushes rewrite rules.
- Namespaced PHP classes live under `includes/` and autoload via `includes/Autoloader.php`.
