# Troubleshooting: Unable to Upgrade from Blue Membership

Members on the **Blue** tier can move up to Gold, Platinum, or Black directly from the mobile app. If you are unable to change your plan, walk through the checks below to resolve the most common blockers.

## 1. Confirm you are signed in

Upgrades require an authenticated session. Verify the following:

1. Open the app and go to **Account → Profile**.
2. Confirm that your email address and Blue membership badge are visible.
3. If you are prompted to log in, sign in with your usual credentials, then return to the upgrade flow.

> Tip: The upgrade buttons are hidden for logged-out users and for accounts that are pending verification.

## 2. Refresh membership data

The membership catalogue is retrieved from the network each time the upgrade screen loads. If the app has been idle, refresh the data:

1. Navigate to **Membership → Upgrade**.
2. Pull down to refresh (iOS/Android gesture) to force the app to reload available plans and pricing.
3. If the list still appears empty, close and relaunch the app to clear cached data.

## 3. Check payment requirements

- Upgrading from **Blue → Gold** requires a THB 500 payment.
- Higher tiers require the fees documented in the membership matrix inside the app.

If the payment sheet does not appear or fails to load:

1. Ensure your device has a stable internet connection.
2. Verify that your saved payment method is valid or add a new card when prompted.
3. If you are using a corporate device, confirm that in-app purchases or web views are not being blocked by device management policies.

## 4. Verify sponsor information (network upgrades)

Members advancing through the **Membership Network Program** must have an assigned sponsor. When sponsors are missing, the app cannot submit the upgrade request.

1. Go to **Account → Network** and confirm a sponsor is listed.
2. If the sponsor field is blank, contact support with your referral code so we can attach the correct sponsor.

## 5. Clear local PIN / biometric locks

If you use the PIN or biometric unlock, mismatched local credentials can prevent the app from restoring your session to complete the upgrade.

1. From the login screen, tap **Use password instead**.
2. Sign in with your account password.
3. Re-enable PIN/biometric unlock after the upgrade completes.

## 6. When to contact support

If the steps above do not resolve the issue, gather the information below and send it to the support team:

- Your account email address and phone number.
- The membership tier you are attempting to purchase.
- A screenshot of the error message or behaviour.
- The date and approximate time of your upgrade attempt.

Email the details to **support@tcnapp.example** or submit them through the in-app **Help → Contact Support** form. The team can verify your account status, reassign sponsors, or manually trigger the upgrade if payment has already been captured.

## 7. Temporary workaround

While the in-app issue is being investigated, you can also upgrade by purchasing the relevant membership from the web storefront. After completing the order, sign back into the app and pull to refresh on the **Membership → Upgrade** screen to sync your new tier.

Keeping these checks in mind should restore access to the upgrade flow and let you move past the Blue tier without delay.
