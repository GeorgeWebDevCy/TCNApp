## üì± React Native Boilerplate Setup

This repository now includes the starter code for a React Native application that uses [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) for push notifications.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 LTS or newer
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) or npm
- Android Studio and/or Xcode for native builds
- A OneSignal account with an application ID

### Getting started
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```
2. Update the placeholder ID in `src/notifications/OneSignalProvider.js` with your OneSignal app ID.
3. Run the Metro bundler
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
4. Launch a platform target (in another terminal)
   ```bash
   yarn android
   # or
   yarn ios
   ```

The app initializes OneSignal on start, requests notification permissions, and ensures foreground notifications display by default. Customize the UI in `src/App.js` and expand notification handling in `src/notifications/OneSignalProvider.js` as you build out the project.---

## Mobile App Authentication

The React Native app now ships with a modular login flow connected to WordPress:

- **Password login**: Uses the WordPress JWT endpoint (`/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token`).
- **PIN login**: Stores a salted hash locally so returning users can unlock without credentials.
- **Biometric login**: Leverages native biometrics (Face ID / Touch ID / etc.) as a fast path once a session exists.
- **Account actions**: "Forgot password" and "Register" links point to the WordPress site and can be customised.

### Configuration

Update `src/config/authConfig.ts` with the correct URLs for your WordPress deployment before building the app.

### Installation Notes

After pulling these changes run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to add the new native modules:

- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
- `crypto-js`
- `react-native-biometrics`

Remember to run the native linking steps required by React Native for any newly added native modules.
